The `acaps` package provides an R wrapper to the ACAPS API, allowing users to easily access the different datasets provided by ACAPS. The package automatically handles pagination and the resulting data is provided as a native R dataframe.


You can install the development version of the package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RenRMT/acaps")
```

## Using the package

You need to have registered an account with ACAPS in order to use the API. A username and password are required to generate an authorization token. You can retrieve your token using the `get_token()` function. Once you've retrieved your authorization token you can store it as an R environment variable using `set_env_token()`. Alternatively, you can provide the token manually with each API call.

```r
library(acaps)

auth_token = get_token(username = "your-email@address.com", password = "your_password")

set_env_token(auth_token)
```

## Using the wrapper functions

The package has easy to use wrapper functions for all existing ACAPS endpoints except for the TÃ¼rkiye & Syria earthquake group of endpoints. You can access any of the endpoints belonging to each of the groups. Each function has the possibility to provide additional parameters in order to filter the dataset, e.g. by country.

```r
get_dataset_access("Jan2023", iso3 = "AFG")

get_dataset_severity("impact-of-crisis", "Jan2023", regions = "Asia")
```


A general function exists in the form of `get_dataset()`, which can be used with any of the endpoints not covered by the above specialized functions.
```r
url <- "https://api.acaps.org/api/v1/turkiye-syria-earthquake/humanitarian-access-events/"

get_dataset(url)

```

Finally two lower level functions are available to be used in different
workflows. These functions can be used to separately retrieve data from the provided 
endpoint or parse the API response as a dataframe.

```r
url <- "https://api.acaps.org/api/v1/countries/"
api_response <- access_endpoint(url)

result <- parse_response(api_response)

```

## Dependencies

This package requires the `httr` and `jsonlite` packages.
